          <summary>Appointments</summary>
          <p>Appointments are highly recommended to better ensure staff availability. To schedule an appointment, text us at 281.739.9138. The more time we are given in advance, the more likely we will be able to accommodate your date request.</p>
        </details>
        
        <details>
            <summary>Walk-ins</summary>
            <p>Walk-ins and same-day appointments may be available but are not guaranteed. To schedule an appointment and to check our availability, text us at 281.739.9138.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Confirmations</summary>
            <p>As a courtesy, we will send a text to confirm your service appointments one day before your appointment date. If we have not received a text response, we will attempt a phone call. If we are unable to reach you, and can only leave a message, please understand that it is your responsibility to remember your appointment dates and times to avoid late arrivals, missed appointments, and the cancellation fee.</p>
        </details>
        
        <details>
            <summary>Cancellations, Re-schedule, No-show</summary>
            <p>Your appointments are very important to us. Each appointment is reserved especially for you. We do understand that sometimes schedule adjustments are necessary; therefore, we respectfully request <strong>24 hours’</strong> notice for adjustments to your appointments and for cancellations.</p>
            <p>Please understand that when you forget or cancel your appointment without giving enough notice, we miss the opportunity to fill that appointment time, and clients on our waiting list miss the opportunity to receive services. Our appointments are confirmed  one day in advance because we know it is possible to forget an appointment you booked months ago. Since the appointment is reserved especially for you, <strong>same day cancellations</strong>, <strong>re-schedule</strong> or <strong>no-show</strong> will be charged full price of the scheduled service.</p>
            <p>If you miss/cancel (same day cancellation) two appointments, your client file will be red flagged which means we will need a credit card to secure your next appointment. We reserve the right to require prepayment.

        <details>
            <summary>Late Arrivals</summary>
                <p> As a courtesy to all clients scheduled throughout the day, on-time arrival is expected.</p>
                <p>To remain on schedule for all our clients, we may shorten your service time if you arrive more than <strong>15 minutes</strong> late for your appointment. The service price will be charged in full.</p>
                 <p>In the case that due to your late arrival, we need to reschedule your appointment in consideration of the next client, you will still be responsible for the full-service fee of your originally scheduled appointment.</p>
                 <p>Any “late” arrival will be documented under your client file. Repetitive behaviors may result in prepayment requirement for future appointments.</p>
        </details>
        
        <details>
            <summary>Refusal of Service</summary>

This includes but is not limited to the usage of drugs, alcohol, sexual comments/remarks, or any unacceptable and disruptive behavior that we feel is inappropriate. As licensed professionals, we follow a strict code of ethics. It is important that a safe environment is maintained for us and each of our clients.</p>
